# Code Projects for PiDay
 Contains all the code foe all of the demonstrations prepared for PiDay 2020, but couldnt be shown due to lockdown. Reference for future commitee.

## Explanation of Each Folder
### Approximate_Pi
This folder contains a bit of processing code to demonstrate the Monte Carlo Method of Approximating Pi (using circles and random points)

### Fourier Transform Draw
This folder contains MATLAB and Processing code to showcase drawing with fourier transform. The processing code is not dynamic, as in it only draws out the pre exisiting path file input into the application. The MATLAB code prompts a gui when the .m file is run to allow the participant to draw the figure out.

### Polygon Pi
This folder contains an unfinished concept* to show how polygons present inside the circle and outside the circle, with increasing side lenght can be used to approximat the value of Pi - an ancient method used by mathematicians.

### Main Rain Digits
This folder contains a Processing script to rain an infintie amount of random digits and is used as the main display of the booth (projector) to attract participants and to showcase the infinite nature of Pi.
